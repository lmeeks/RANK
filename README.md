This tool is a network analysis tool to identify and rank stability, topological signifiance, and redundancy for networks. The example looks at the water resources network for the Lower Bear River. The tool builds on theories of parallel coordinates with statistical analysis to quantify and compare network nodes. The tool is available for download at https://github.com/lmeeks/RANK. The tool's file name is Rank.xlsm which is a macro-enabled file. To test RANK, an example 10-node network Excel file is also avaiable named ExampleNetwork.xlsx.
