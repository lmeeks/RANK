RANK tool for water resources network analysis

This tool is a network analysis tool to identify and rank stability, topological signifiance, and redundancy for networks. The example looks at the water resources network for the Lower Bear River. The tool builds on theories of parallel coordinates with statistical analysis to quantify and compare network nodes. The tool is available for download at https://github.com/lmeeks/RANK. It is a macro-enabled Excel file.
